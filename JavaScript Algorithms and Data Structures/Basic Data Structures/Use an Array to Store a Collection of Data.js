// Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data

// The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data structure. 
// This is known as a one-dimensional array, meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. 
// Notice it contains booleans, strings, and numbers, among other valid JavaScript data types:

let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];
console.log(simpleArray.length);
